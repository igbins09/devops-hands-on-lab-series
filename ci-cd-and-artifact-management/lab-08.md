## Steps Taken

### Nexus Installation
1. Launched a small Red Hat EC2 instance and opened port 8081 in the security group.

3. Extracted Nexus and configured proper permissions under a new `nexus` user.
4. Updated memory settings and configured Nexus to run as a systemd service.
5. Enabled the service and verified it was running via logs and status checks.
6. Accessed Nexus via browser and retrieved the admin password from the instance.
7. Logged in, changed the admin password, and confirmed the dashboard loaded successfully.

### Jenkins Integration
1. Installed the Nexus Artifact Uploader plugin in Jenkins.
2. In an existing Freestyle job:
   - Configured GitHub as the SCM
   - Added Maven build steps (`clean install`)
   - Added a Nexus artifact upload step with appropriate repository and artifact details
3. Ran a build and verified the `.war` artifact was successfully uploaded to the `maven-snapshots` repository in Nexus.
